// Part of an Analogue Pocket openFPGA core for Nintendo's Punch-Out!! board.
// Hardware behaviour derived from MAME's nintendo/punchout.cpp by Nicola
// Salmoria; see README.md for full credits.
//! Cabinet reverb: a short, dark room around the whole mix.
//!
//! Three parallel feedback comb filters at 29.7, 37.1 and 41.1 ms (mutually
//! prime lengths, so their tails do not line up into a ring), each with a
//! one-pole low-pass in its loop so the tail darkens as it decays, feedback
//! 5/8 (about 0.5 s to -60 dB); their sum is added under the dry signal at
//! 1/8 (Light) or 1/4 (Medium). Schroeder's arrangement without the allpass
//! stage: at this length and level the combs' own density is enough, and the
//! allpass adds nothing a Pocket speaker would show.
//!
//! One sample per ce (48 kHz); the work is sequential and takes a few dozen
//! clocks of the 2000 available. Delay lines in block RAM, 3 x 2048 x 16.
//! All arithmetic is shifts and adds; every sum is saturated.
